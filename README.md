**beegae** is a port of beego intended to be used on Google's AppEngine. There are a few subtle differences between how beego and beegae initalizes applications which you can see for yourself here [example](https://github.com/astaxie/beegae/tree/master/example)

The aim of this project is to keep as much of beego unchanged as possible in beegae.

## Features

* Datastore + Memcached backed session store! [read more here](http://beego.me/docs/mvc/controller/session.md) to learn how to use it.
* `AppEngineCtx` is part of the default Controller.
